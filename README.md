I developed a web-based system for Uber that manages customers, drivers, cabs, and trip bookings. Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the key features:

Admin Entity:

Registers new admins.
Updates existing admin passwords.
Deletes existing admins.
Customer Entity:

Registers new customers.
Deletes existing customers.
Books trips.
Assigns the nearest available driver and cab to the customer.
Allows trip cancellation or completion.
Driver Entity:

Registers new drivers.
Deletes existing drivers.
Updates cab status (available or unavailable).
Cab Entity:

Stores per-kilometer rate.
Tracks cab availability.
TripBooking Entity:

Records trip details (start and drop-off locations, distance, status, and bill).
